**flowchart of Cassandraâ€™s architecture**

### ðŸ”¹ Flow Explanation

1. **Client (Application)**

   * Sends read/write requests to Cassandra.

2. **Coordinator Node**

   * The node that first receives the clientâ€™s request.
   * Decides which nodes hold the data (based on partition key + consistent hashing).

3. **Cluster Nodes (Ring Architecture)**

   * Each node stores a portion of data.
   * Data is **replicated** across nodes (e.g., RF=3).
   * Nodes talk to each other (peer-to-peer, no master).

4. **Inside Each Node**

   * **Commit Log** â†’ writes recorded for durability.
   * **MemTable** â†’ in-memory store for fast access.
   * **SSTables** â†’ flushed to disk in immutable files.

âš¡ **Key Solid Points**:

* Any node can act as **coordinator** (no master bottleneck).
* Data is **replicated across nodes** for fault tolerance.
* Storage engine = Commit Log + MemTable + SSTables (like a write-optimized pipeline).
* Peer-to-peer **ring architecture** ensures **no single point of failure**.
