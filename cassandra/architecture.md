**flowchart of Cassandra’s architecture** 

---

### 🔹 Flow Explanation

1. **Client (Application)**

   * Sends read/write requests to Cassandra.

2. **Coordinator Node**

   * The node that first receives the client’s request.
   * Decides which nodes hold the data (based on partition key + consistent hashing).

3. **Cluster Nodes (Ring Architecture)**

   * Each node stores a portion of data.
   * Data is **replicated** across nodes (e.g., RF=3).
   * Nodes talk to each other (peer-to-peer, no master).

4. **Inside Each Node**

   * **Commit Log** → writes recorded for durability.
   * **MemTable** → in-memory store for fast access.
   * **SSTables** → flushed to disk in immutable files.

⚡ **Key Solid Points**:

* Any node can act as **coordinator** (no master bottleneck).
* Data is **replicated across nodes** for fault tolerance.
* Storage engine = Commit Log + MemTable + SSTables (like a write-optimized pipeline).
* Peer-to-peer **ring architecture** ensures **no single point of failure**.

Got it 👍 Let’s go deeper into **Cassandra’s read and write flow** — but in **step-by-step arrow style text** (no images), so it’s crystal clear.

### 📌 Cassandra Write Path 

When an **application writes data** (INSERT/UPDATE):

```
Client → Coordinator Node → Replication → Storage
```

1️⃣ **Client sends write request**

* Example: `INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');`

2️⃣ **Coordinator Node receives it**

* Any node can be a coordinator.
* Decides which nodes are responsible for this partition (based on partition key + consistent hashing).

3️⃣ **Replication to multiple nodes**

* If Replication Factor = 3, then 3 nodes will store this data.
* Consistency Level (e.g., ONE, QUORUM, ALL) decides how many nodes must ACK before success.

4️⃣ **Inside each node (write process)**

* **Commit Log** → Write is appended for durability (so it’s safe even if node crashes).
* **MemTable** → Data stored in memory for fast access.
* Once MemTable is full → flushed to disk as **SSTable (immutable file)**.

✅ Solid Point: Cassandra writes are **fast and durable** because they are **append-only**.

### 📌 Cassandra Read Path

When an **application reads data** (SELECT):

```
Client → Coordinator Node → Replica Nodes → Response
```

1️⃣ **Client sends read request**

* Example: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;`

2️⃣ **Coordinator Node receives it**

* Figures out which nodes have the data.
* Sends read requests to replicas.

3️⃣ **Replica Nodes return results**

* Each node checks:

  * **MemTable** (fastest, in-memory)
  * **SSTables** (on-disk)
  * Uses **Bloom filters + Indexes** to avoid scanning all SSTables.

4️⃣ **Consistency check**

* Coordinator waits for enough replicas (based on CL = ONE, QUORUM, ALL).
* If data differs → background **read repair** happens.

5️⃣ **Coordinator sends final result back to client.**

✅ Solid Point: Reads are **eventually consistent** but can be made strongly consistent (with QUORUM/ALL).

# 📌 Write + Read Flow Together (Easy Arrow Flow)

### **Write Path**

```
Client → Coordinator → Commit Log (Durability)
                      → MemTable (In-Memory)
                      → Flush → SSTables (Disk)
                      → Replicated to other nodes
```

### **Read Path**

```
Client → Coordinator → Replica Nodes
                      → MemTable + SSTables
                      → Consistency Check
                      → Return Result
```

# 📌 Why This Matters

* **Fast writes** → because they are append-only (Commit Log + MemTable).
* **Reads are more complex** → because data may exist in multiple SSTables, needing merging + consistency check.
* **Replication** → guarantees high availability across datacenters.
* **Consistency level tuning** → lets you balance speed vs safety.
