suppose i have a table with 100 records according to above example how many partition it will create generally with use case 

Short answer: **Cassandra creates one partition for each distinct partition-key value.**
So if your table has 100 rows and each row uses a different partition key, you will have **100 partitions**. If multiple rows share the same partition key (i.e., you use clustering columns to store many rows inside one partition) then the number of partitions will be **less than 100**.

Below I give a few concrete use-cases and the resulting partition counts, plus important practical notes.

# Examples / use cases

1. **Simple employee table — one row per employee**

   * Schema: `PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)` or `PRIMARY KEY ((employee_name))`
   * 100 rows → **100 partitions** (one partition per employee)
   * Use case: lookups by employee id/name (point reads). Good design for Cassandra.

2. **Employee events (time-series) — many events per employee**

   * Schema: `PRIMARY KEY ((employee_id), event_time)` (employee\_id = partition key, event\_time = clustering)
   * 100 event rows but only 10 employees → **10 partitions** (each partition contains \~10 rows)
   * Use case: fetch recent events for an employee efficiently. Beware partition growth over time.

3. **Batch/append log with global partition key**

   * Schema: `PRIMARY KEY ((constant_bucket), event_time)` — you intentionally bucket many rows into a small number of partitions
   * 100 rows → **1 partition** (if all rows use same partition key)
   * Use case: not usually recommended — causes a hot partition and read/write hotspot.

4. **Composite partitioning / bucketing**

   * Schema: `PRIMARY KEY ((user_id, year_month), ts)` — you bucket by user+month
   * 100 rows spread across 20 users and 3 months → maybe **\~60 partitions** (depends on distribution)
   * Use case: keep partition sizes bounded while enabling per-user time-range queries.

# How data is stored across the cluster (quick numbers given RF=3, 7 nodes)

* If you have **100 partitions** and `RF=3` the cluster stores **300 replicas** total (100 × 3).
* With 7 nodes that’s about `300 / 7 ≈ 42–43` replicas per node (same math I showed earlier). Which partitions are primary on which node depends on tokens.

# Practical guidance / best practices

* **Partition = distinct partition key.** Design your partition key to match access patterns.
* **Target partition size**: keep partitions reasonably sized (commonly recommended << 100 MB; often < tens of MB). Very large partitions hurt performance.
* **Avoid very small numbers of partitions** (hotspots) and very large partitions (compactions/tombstones cost).
* **Use bucketing** (e.g., user+month) for high-cardinality time series so partitions stay bounded.
* **For point-lookup workloads** (one row per entity) one partition per entity is perfect — 100 rows → 100 partitions.
* **For append/time series** prefer a bucketing strategy so partitions grow predictably.

# Quick checklist to decide partition count for your table

1. What is the partition key? — distinct values = partition count.
2. Do you have clustering columns? — multiple rows can live in one partition → fewer partitions.
3. Expected rows per partition? — if > thousands or large bytes, consider bucketing.
4. Access pattern: single-row lookups → one partition per entity is fine; time-range queries → bucket appropriately.

If you tell me your actual table schema (partition key + clustering columns) and the 100 records’ distribution (one row per key or many rows share keys), I’ll compute the exact partition count and show how those partitions would map across the 7-node RF=3 ring with node-by-node replica counts.
