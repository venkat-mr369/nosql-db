## create keyspace mydb WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1}; data loaded 1M records now client asked to change dc1 3 , 
dc2 3 with networktopology is it possible? what is the comand ?

You created `mydb` initially with **SimpleStrategy** (single data center).
Now the client wants **multi-datacenter replication** with `NetworkTopologyStrategy` (e.g., `dc1=3`, `dc2=3`).

### üîé Is it possible to change replication after data is loaded?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî Cassandra lets you **alter the keyspace replication**.
‚ö†Ô∏è But ‚Äî changing strategy **does not automatically rebalance existing data**. After altering, you must run **`nodetool repair`** to ensure data is replicated to the new DC/nodes correctly.

---

## üîß Command to change replication

In **cqlsh**:

```sql
ALTER KEYSPACE mydb 
WITH replication = {
  'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy',
  'dc1': 3,
  'dc2': 3
};
```

---

### üîÅ Steps to follow

1. **Check your datacenter names**
   Run:

   ```bash
   nodetool status
   ```

   You‚Äôll see something like:

   ```
   Datacenter: dc1
   Datacenter: dc2
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Use *exact names* shown there (case-sensitive).

2. **Alter keyspace replication** (command above).

3. **Validate schema change**

   ```sql
   DESCRIBE KEYSPACE mydb;
   ```

4. **Re-replicate existing data**
   On each node:

   ```bash
   nodetool repair mydb
   ```

   This ensures the 1M rows get pushed to the new replicas in both DCs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* `SimpleStrategy` should **never be used for production** in multi-DC ‚Äî only for dev/test.
* Moving to `NetworkTopologyStrategy` is the **right choice** for HA.
* Ensure each DC actually has at least 3 nodes available, otherwise `replication_factor=3` will fail.

‚úÖ **Final Answer below the command**

```sql
ALTER KEYSPACE mydb 
WITH replication = {
  'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy',
  'dc1': 3,
  'dc2': 3
};
```
