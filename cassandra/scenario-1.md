**Question:-**
suppose i have 7 nodes a emp table having 100 records like name1,name2,name3 in empdb  
how the data will store according across all nodes, server names like casserv1,casserv2,casserv3 ?

**Answer**
* the token/ring idea,
* how each row is placed (primary + replicas),
* an explicit small example (7 sample rows),
* write & read arrow flows for a sample row (with consistency levels),
* how vnode vs single-token changes behavior,
* what happens on node failure and how repair/hinted-handoff works,
* useful commands to check this in your cluster.

# Assumptions (typical defaults)

* Partitioner: **Murmur3Partitioner** (Cassandra default).
* Replication strategy: **SimpleStrategy**.
* Replication factor (**RF**) = **3** (each partition is stored on 3 nodes).
* 7 physical nodes named `casserv1` → `casserv7`.
* Partition key for `emp` is `name` (so `name1`... are partition keys).
* vnodes **may** be enabled (default `num_tokens=256`) — I’ll show both single-token and vnode behavior.

# 1) The token ring — how nodes are placed

Cassandra maps every partition key to a 64-bit token (via Murmur3). Nodes are given token positions on the ring. A key’s token finds the first node *clockwise* whose token is greater-or-equal and that node becomes the **primary replica**. Then Cassandra takes the next `RF-1` nodes clockwise as additional replicas.

If we evenly place 7 single tokens around the full Murmur3 range, node token anchors (example numbers) could be:

* `casserv1` token ≈ `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808`
* `casserv2` token ≈ `-6,588,122,883,467,697,006`
* `casserv3` token ≈ `-3,952,873,730,080,618,204`
* `casserv4` token ≈ `-1,317,624,576,693,539,402`
* `casserv5` token ≈ `1,317,624,576,693,539,400`
* `casserv6` token ≈ `3,952,873,730,080,618,202`
* `casserv7` token ≈ `6,588,122,883,467,697,004`

(Those are the 7 evenly spaced token anchors — you don’t need to memorize the numbers. You only need to know “tokens live on a ring; keys map to tokens; replicas are next `RF` nodes clockwise”.)

# 2) Expected distribution for **100 rows**

* With **uniform hashing**, \~equal distribution is expected.
* **Primary partitions per node** ≈ `100 / 7 ≈ 14–15` rows per node (some nodes 14, some 15).
* With **RF = 3**, total stored copies = `100 × 3 = 300` copies across cluster.

  * So **each physical node** will store roughly `300 / 7 ≈ 42–43` row copies (primary + replicas combined).

So: each node is primary for \~14–15 partitions and *also* holds replicas of other partitions so the storage/IO is roughly \~42–43 partitions’ worth.

---

# 3) Concrete example (7 sample names → show primary + replicas)

I’ll pick a representative token in the center of each node’s token range (so it’s clearly owned by that node). These are *example* token values (midpoints) — they show mapping logic:

| sample  |              token (example) | primary node | replicas (RF=3)                |
| ------- | ---------------------------: | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `name1` | `-7,905,747,460,161,236,407` | `casserv1`   | `casserv1, casserv2, casserv3` |
| `name2` | `-5,270,498,306,774,157,605` | `casserv2`   | `casserv2, casserv3, casserv4` |
| `name3` | `-2,635,249,153,387,078,803` | `casserv3`   | `casserv3, casserv4, casserv5` |
| `name4` |                         `-1` | `casserv4`   | `casserv4, casserv5, casserv6` |
| `name5` |  `2,635,249,153,387,078,801` | `casserv5`   | `casserv5, casserv6, casserv7` |
| `name6` |  `5,270,498,306,774,157,603` | `casserv6`   | `casserv6, casserv7, casserv1` |
| `name7` |  `7,905,747,460,161,236,405` | `casserv7`   | `casserv7, casserv1, casserv2` |

Notes:

* After `casserv7`, the ring wraps back to `casserv1`.
* This table shows the **primary** (where the token falls) and the two **successor nodes** clockwise that hold replicas.

You can imagine the same for all 100 rows — each name's Murmur3 hash puts it somewhere on the ring and the same rule picks primary + next two nodes.

# 4) Write flow for a single insert (arrow style)

Suppose client writes `INSERT INTO emp (name, age) VALUES ('name3', 30);` and **client is connected to `casserv4`** (it becomes the *coordinator* for that op):

```
Client --> casserv4 (coordinator)
    casserv4 computes token('name3') --> finds primary = casserv3, replicas = casserv3,casserv4,casserv5 (example)
    casserv4 forwards write to each replica (or to the proper set)
Replica nodes:
    each replica: append to CommitLog (durable)  --> update MemTable (in-memory)
Once required ACKs are received (based on CL), coordinator returns SUCCESS to Client
Background: MemTable flushes -> SSTables; compaction runs later
```

Important details:

* **Coordinator** might be any node the client hits — not necessarily the primary.
* Replicas write to **commit log + memtable** (append-only), which is why writes are fast.
* **Acknowledgement** (when coordinator returns success) depends on the **Consistency Level (CL)**:

  * `CL = ONE` → coordinator waits for 1 replica ack (fast)
  * `CL = QUORUM` → wait for 2 acks (for RF=3)
  * `CL = ALL` → wait for all 3 acks (slowest, strongest)

---

# 5) Read flow for a single select (arrow style)

Client `SELECT * FROM emp WHERE name='name3';` (client connected to `casserv1`):

```
Client --> casserv1 (coordinator)
    casserv1 computes token('name3') --> primary = casserv3 (replicas casserv3,casserv4,casserv5)
Coordinator asks replicas for data (strategy depends on CL & read optimization)
    one replica returns full data; others may return digests
Coordinator compares digests (if mismatch -> triggers read repair)
Coordinator returns data to Client
```

Consistency examples:

* `CL = ONE`: fastest, one replica needs to respond. If the responding replica is slightly stale, eventual read repair may reconcile.
* `CL = QUORUM` (2 of 3): stronger consistency — coordinator waits for two agreeing replicas.
* `CL = ALL`: all 3 must agree.

Cassandra optimizes reads: it may request full data from one replica and digests from others to save IO, then reconcile.

---

# 6) Vnodes (num\_tokens) vs single-token nodes — what changes

* **Single-token per node** (old style): each node owns exactly one contiguous range of the ring. When you add/remove a node, large contiguous ranges move — can cause big rebalancing.
* **Vnodes (default, e.g., `num_tokens=256`)**: each physical node owns many small token ranges (256 virtual tokens). These ranges are interleaved for each node across the ring.

**Practical effects of vnodes:**

* Much **smoother distribution** of partitions across nodes (less chance of “hot” node).
* **When adding/removing a node**, data movement is much smaller and balanced — less manual re-tokening.
* For our 100-row example, the *average* primary per node is still \~14–15, but with vnodes it’s much less likely that one node will have many more primaries than others.

---

# 7) Failure behavior — example: `casserv3` is down

* With `RF = 3`, `name3` is stored on `casserv3,casserv4,casserv5`. If `casserv3` is down:

  * **Writes**:

    * Coordinator can write to the available replicas (`casserv4`, `casserv5`).
    * If `CL = QUORUM` (2), the write succeeds (2 acks).
    * If some replica is down but not enough to satisfy CL, coordinator will fail or write hints.
  * **Hinted handoff**:

    * Coordinator can keep a **hint** for the unavailable replica. When `casserv3` comes back, the hint is replayed to it to fill missing writes.
  * **Read**:

    * If `CL = QUORUM`, still possible (2 replicas available). If `CL = ALL`, read will fail until all replicas are up.
  * **Repair**:

    * Over time, **read-repair** or scheduled `nodetool repair` will reconcile any divergence between replicas.

---

# 8) Anti-entropy & repairs

* **Read repair**: automatic background reconciliation when reads detect mismatched data.
* **Hinted handoff**: quick mechanism to preserve writes for temporarily down replicas.
* **nodetool repair** (manual/periodic): ensures long-term consistency between replicas and should be run for downtime/after topology changes.

---

# 9) Useful commands to *see* this mapping in a real cluster

* In `cqlsh` you can compute the token for a key:

  ```sql
  SELECT token(name) FROM emp WHERE name = 'name3';
  ```

  That shows the token value where `'name3'` maps.

* See node tokens & ownership:

  ```bash
  nodetool status
  # or (older)
  nodetool ring
  ```

  This shows nodes, tokens (or token ranges), and % ownership.

* Get endpoints (which nodes will hold a given partition):

  ```bash
  nodetool getendpoints <keyspace> <table> <partition_key>
  # e.g.
  nodetool getendpoints empdb emp name3
  ```

  (Command availability/format varies with versions — `getendpoints` is a useful nodetool helper to find replica nodes for a key.)

* Rebalance/cleanup when nodes added/removed:

  ```bash
  nodetool cleanup
  nodetool repair
  ```

---

# 10) Quick summary (practical points to remember)

* Each row’s **partition key** → Murmur3 hash → **token** → primary replica determined by ring order.
* With `RF=3`, each key is stored on 3 nodes: primary + 2 successors clockwise.
* For **100 rows on 7 nodes**, expect \~14–15 primary partitions per node and \~42–43 stored copies total per node.
* **Coordinator** (where the client connects) forwards to replicas — success depends on **Consistency Level**.
* **Vnodes** greatly improve evenness and reduce rebalancing pain.
* On node failure, **hinted handoff**, **read-repair**, and **nodetool repair** restore consistency; CL and RF determine availability.

---

If you want, I can now:

* produce a short table showing **exact expected primary counts** for every node (14 or 15) and expected replica counts per node, or
* walk a single row (`name42`) through *every* internal step including exact commit-log/memtable/sstable timeline and what nodetool commands you'd run to validate, or
* give a tiny script / cqlsh commands to list tokens for `name1..name100` so you can see distribution on your cluster.
