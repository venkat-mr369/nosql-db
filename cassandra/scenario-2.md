how to produce a short table showing exact expected primary counts for every node (14 or 15) and expected replica counts per node, or
walk through a single row (name42) through every internal step including exact commit-log/memtable/sstable timeline and what nodetool commands you will do for validate?

Nice — I’ll do both: (A) a short table that answers the “14 or 15 primaries” question for a 7-node cluster with 100 partition keys, 
and (B) a step-by-step trace of a single partition (row `name42`) through Cassandra internals (exact commitlog → memtable → SSTable timeline) 
plus the exact `nodetool` / cqlsh commands you’d run to validate each step.

**Assumptions I used for example so the numbers are exact and reproducible**

* 7 nodes named `casserv1` `casserv2`… `casserv7`
* Murmur3 partitioner, tokens evenly distributed (vnodes or single-token ring that results in even primary distribution)
* 100 distinct partitions (the 100 names: name1..name100)
* Replication factor `RF = 3` (common), SimpleStrategy (or NetworkTopologyStrategy with same RF per DC)
* Consistency level defaults used in examples: `QUORUM` for writes/reads
* Even hash distribution so primaries are as evenly split as possible: `floor(100/7)=14` with remainder `2` → two nodes get 15 primaries, five nodes get 14 primaries
* Replica placement follows the ring (each partition stored on its primary + next 2 nodes clockwise)

Notes / verification of table math:

* Total primaries = 2×15 + 5×14 = 100 (matches partitions).
* Total replicas across cluster = 100 partitions × RF(3) = 300.
* Total replicas distributed across nodes = 6 nodes × 43 + 1 node × 42 = 300.
* Non-primary replicas = total replicas per node − primaries per node. (The particular node that ends up with 42 vs 43 depends on token placement; I assigned `casserv7` as the single 42 for concreteness — ring placement can shift which node gets 42.)

If you want the exact mapping of *which partition* (e.g., `name42`) is primary on which node, you can use `nodetool getendpoints` or `TOKEN` lookup; I show how below.

---

# B — Walk `name42` (a single partition) through the exact internal steps and the commands to validate each step

Assume `keyspace = empks`, `table = emp` and partition key value = `'name42'`. We’ll show the timeline for a single successful write from client to final stable SSTable.

### 1) Client/Driver determines partition token and chooses coordinator

* Driver hashes `name42` with Murmur3 → token `T` (deterministic).
* Driver sends the write to any node (often the local contact point). The node that receives the request becomes the **coordinator**.
* The coordinator uses token `T` and the cluster ring to determine the 3 replica nodes for that token (primary + two successors).

**Commands to find endpoints for `name42`:**

```bash
# from any node (or from a machine with nodetool pointed at a node)
nodetool getendpoints empks emp "'name42'"
# or with cqlsh (gives primary token)
SELECT token(partition_key_column) FROM empks.emp WHERE partition_key_column='name42';
```

(`nodetool getendpoints` returns the three replica hostnames/IPs that will store `name42`.)

---

### 2) Coordinator sends write to all replica nodes (write path)

* Coordinator forwards the write RPC to all 3 replicas (for CL=QUORUM it needs at least 2 acks).
* On *each replica node*, Cassandra does these steps **synchronously** for durability:

  1. **Append the mutation to the local commitlog** (append-only write; fsync behavior depends on `commitlog_sync` and `commitlog_sync_period_in_ms` or `commitlog_sync=periodic` vs `batch`)
  2. **Apply the mutation to the in-memory memtable** for that table (partition key’s memtable).
  3. **Acknowledge** back to the coordinator (once these steps succeed locally).
* Coordinator waits for required number of replica acknowledgements (e.g., QUORUM = 2/3) and returns success to client.

**Validation commands / checks right after write succeeds:**

1. Identify replica nodes:

```bash
nodetool getendpoints empks emp "'name42'"
# → returns e.g. casserv3,casserv4,casserv5
```

2. On each replica node, check commitlog write position (no direct simple command shows your specific entry, but you can check commitlog activity and memtable status):

```bash
# Check commitlog stats and pending tasks
nodetool tpstats
nodetool netstats
```

3. Check table memtable size / counts (shows whether recent writes are still in memtable):

```bash
# newer nodetool:
nodetool tablestats empks emp
# older:
nodetool cfstats empks.emp
```

Look for `MemtableColumnsCount`, `MemtableSwitchCount`, `Live SSTable count`, `MemtableSize`. Immediately after write you should see memtable size increased and SSTable count unchanged (until flush).

4. Confirm row readable via CQL (from any coordinator, at QUORUM):

```bash
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY QUORUM;
cqlsh> SELECT * FROM empks.emp WHERE partition_key_column='name42';
```

If write succeeded at QUORUM, this read should return the row.

---

### 3) Commitlog → Memtable durability details and fsync

* Write order: **commitlog append → update memtable**. This guarantees that if the node crashes, the commitlog can replay to restore memtables.
* `commitlog_sync` setting controls whether each write fsyncs the commitlog synchronously (`batch`) or periodically (`periodic`), which affects durability window. (Default often `periodic` with `commitlog_sync_period_in_ms`.)

**How to check commitlog settings:**

```bash
# read cassandra.yaml on each node, or show via nodetool info
grep -E "commitlog_sync|commitlog_sync_period_in_ms" /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
nodetool info
```

---

### 4) Memtable flush → SSTable creation (when and how)

Memtables are flushed to disk as SSTables when:

* Memtable size for that table exceeds `memtable_heap_space_in_mb` or `memtable_offheap_space_in_mb`, **or**
* Periodic flush triggers, or
* `nodetool flush` is invoked, or
* Node is shutting down / compaction triggers compaction/flush.

When flush occurs on a replica:

1. The memtable contents are written to an immutable SSTable file on disk (SSTable component files appear in data directory).
2. Memtable is cleared (reset).
3. SSTable is added to the table’s SSTable list and is visible for reads.

**Force a flush (useful in tests):**

```bash
nodetool flush empks emp
# This forces memtables for empks.emp to be flushed to SSTables on the local node.
```

**Check resulting SSTables and metadata:**

* After flush, list SSTables (on the node’s data directory) or use `nodetool tablestats`:

```bash
nodetool tablestats empks emp
# Look at "Number of SSTables", "Space used (live)", "SSTable count by level" (if LeveledCompaction).
```

* To inspect SSTable content for the specific partition:

  * Use `sstabledump` to inspect SSTable(s) JSON and search for `name42`. Example (run on the replica node, point to SSTable file):

```bash
sstabledump /var/lib/cassandra/data/empks/emp-<uuid>/mc-*-Data.db | grep -A20 '"partition_key": "name42"'
```

(Exact path depends on your data directory and keyspace/table identifiers.)

---

### 5) Compaction & eventual state

* Later, compaction may merge multiple SSTables and drop tombstones; compaction does not change correctness for that partition.
* Repairs (`nodetool repair`) ensure replicas converge if some writes were missed (due to hinted handoff or downtime).

**Validate data converged and replicas have row:**

```bash
# Check each replica node:
cqlsh casserv3> CONSISTENCY LOCAL_ONE; SELECT * FROM empks.emp WHERE partition_key_column='name42';
# Or to verify at QUORUM from a client:
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY QUORUM; SELECT * FROM empks.emp WHERE partition_key_column='name42';
```

**Check which nodes have the latest data version (useful after node down / hinted handoff):**

```bash
# see pending hints or hinted handoff metrics
nodetool netstats
# list hints on coordinator (if any):
nodetool ring   # (shows status; deprecated in newer versions but helpful)
nodetool status
nodetool describecluster
```

---

### 6) If a replica was down during write — hinted handoff & repairs

* If one of the replicas was down, coordinator will either:

  * Store a *hint* (if hinted handoff enabled) to deliver to that node later, and still return success if required CL acknowledgements satisfied, or
  * Return write failure if CL cannot be met.
* When the down node comes back, hinted handoff (or repair) will deliver missing mutations.

**Commands to inspect and replay hints and run repair:**

```bash
# see pending hints (netstats)
nodetool netstats

# run repair to synchronize data proactively (use -full or -pr carefully)
nodetool repair empks

# or repair primary ranges only
nodetool repair -pr empks
```

---

### 7) Exact sequence summary for `name42` (timeline form)

1. Client hashes `'name42'` → token `T`. Client sends `INSERT` to coordinator node.
2. Coordinator determines replicas (e.g., casserv3, casserv4, casserv5).
3. Coordinator forwards mutation RPC to casserv3/4/5.
4. On each replica (in parallel):

   * Append mutation to local commitlog (durable append).
   * Update memtable for `empks.emp`.
   * Return ACK to coordinator.
5. Coordinator receives necessary acks (QUORUM) → returns success to client.
6. At this point: mutation durable in commitlog and visible from memtable reads.

   * `nodetool tablestats` shows increased memtable size; `SELECT` at CONSISTENCY QUORUM reads it.
7. At flush threshold (or after `nodetool flush`) memtable is written to SSTable(s) — now row is present on-disk in SSTable files.

   * Use `sstabledump` to confirm row exists in an SSTable.
8. Later compactions/repairs ensure all replicas converge; if any replica missed write, hinted handoff or `nodetool repair` will make it consistent.

# Quick checklist of exact `nodetool` & shell commands to validate each state

1. **Which nodes are replicas for `name42`:**

```bash
nodetool getendpoints empks emp "'name42'"
```

2. **After write — validate memtable/commitlog presence and readability:**

```bash
nodetool tablestats empks emp
cqlsh> CONSISTENCY QUORUM; SELECT * FROM empks.emp WHERE partition_key_column='name42';
nodetool tpstats
nodetool netstats
```

3. **Force flush (makes SSTable appear) and confirm:**

```bash
nodetool flush empks emp
nodetool tablestats empks emp   # SSTable count should increase
# Then inspect SSTable for the row (on the replica node's filesystem)
sstabledump /var/lib/cassandra/data/empks/emp-*/mc-*-Data.db | grep -A20 '"partition_key": "name42"'
```

4. **Check cluster status and ring/token distribution:**

```bash
nodetool status
nodetool ring   # older clusters; shows tokens/ownership
nodetool describecluster
```

5. **Repair / convergence (if nodes were down):**

```bash
nodetool repair empks
nodetool netstats   # shows hints, streaming activity
```

---

If you want, I can:

* map *exactly* which node(s) have the 43 vs 42 replica counts for your real cluster tokens (I’d run `nodetool status` and `nodetool getendpoints` for each partition) — give me the `nodetool status` output or let me assume token ordering, and I’ll produce the exact node-by-node mapping; **or**
* produce a visual arrow-based flow (text flowchart) that walks `name42` across coordinator → replicas → commitlog/memtable → flush → SSTable → compaction/repair.
